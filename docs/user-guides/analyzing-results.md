# User Guide: Analyzing Your Results

Welcome to the Beseek results analysis guide. This document will walk you through how to interpret, query, and refine your search results to gain deeper insights from your documents.

## Understanding the Results Overview

After you perform a search or apply a set of criteria, Beseek presents the results in a clear, table-like overview. Each row in the table represents a document or a group of documents that match your query, providing a high-level summary of the key information extracted.

This overview is designed to give you a quick snapshot of the most relevant findings, allowing you to easily compare and prioritize documents for further analysis.

## Drilling Down into Details

To explore a specific result in more detail, you can click on any row in the overview table. This action will open a detailed view that shows the complete data extractions and in-depth analysis for that particular document or document group.

In this view, you can examine the exact text that was extracted, review the AI-powered analysis, and understand the context behind the summary presented in the overview.

## Asking Questions about Your Data

Beseek provides a unified input field that serves as a powerful tool for interactive data analysis. You can use this field to ask questions in natural language to interrogate your documents.

You can pose questions about:
*   **All Documents:** Ask a general question to get insights from the entire dataset you've uploaded.
*   **Specific Document/Group:** Focus your query on a single document or a pre-defined group of documents to get more targeted answers.

This Q&A capability allows you to have a conversation with your data, making it easy to find specific information without having to manually sift through documents.

## Refining Your Analysis

Your analysis process is dynamic. As you uncover new insights, you may want to adjust your focus. Beseek makes this easy by allowing you to update your search criteria at any time.

When you modify the criteria in the input field, the results overview automatically refreshes in real-time to reflect your changes. This iterative process allows you to continuously refine your analysis, test new hypotheses, and quickly narrow down to the most critical information.
