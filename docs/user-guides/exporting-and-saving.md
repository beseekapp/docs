# User Guide: Exporting and Saving

This guide provides an overview of how to export, save, and manage your results and workflows in Beseek.

## Downloading Your Results

After running a workflow and obtaining results, you can download the data in several convenient formats. This allows you to use the information in other applications or for offline analysis.

The following formats are available for download:
*   **Text (.txt):** A plain text file containing the results.
*   **CSV (.csv):** A comma-separated values file, suitable for use in spreadsheets.
*   **Excel (.xlsx):** A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
*   **PDF (.pdf):** A portable document format file, ideal for sharing and printing.
*   **Image (.png):** A PNG image of the results view.

## Exporting Packaged Documents

For more comprehensive exporting needs, you can package your results.

*   **Zip File:** Export the results as a packaged Zip archive. This is useful for downloading all related documents and data at once.
*   **Online Storage:** Save the exported package directly to an online storage location, such as Google Drive or Dropbox.

## Managing Your Workflows

Beseek provides several features to manage your workflows efficiently.

*   **Automatic Saving:** Every workflow you create or run is automatically saved to your account. You can access your history of workflows at any time.
*   **Saving as a Template:** If you have a workflow that you will reuse frequently, you can save it as a template. This allows you to quickly create new, similar workflows without starting from scratch.
*   **Scheduled and Triggered Workflows:** When both the source and export locations for your workflow are online storage services, you can automate its execution:
    *   **Scheduled Workflow:** Set the workflow to run at specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
    *   **Triggered Workflow:** Configure the workflow to run automatically whenever a new file is added to the source location.
