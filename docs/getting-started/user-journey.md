# Getting Started: Your First Workflow

This guide will walk you through creating your first workflow in Beseek, from uploading documents to exporting your results.

1.  **Upload or Select Your Data**
    Start by either uploading documents directly from your computer or connecting to an online storage service (like Google Drive or Dropbox) to select your files or folders.

2.  **Define Your Criteria**
    Next, you'll need to tell Beseek how to filter and sort your documents. You can either write your criteria using simple text commands or use the intuitive drag-and-drop criteria builder to construct your rules visually.

3.  **Review the Overview**
    Beseek will process your documents based on your criteria and present an overview of the results in a clear, table-like format. This allows you to see a high-level summary of the extracted information.

4.  **Ask Questions and Refine**
    A unified input field allows you to interact with your data. You can ask questions about your documents or enter new criteria to refine the search without starting over.

5.  **Dive into the Details**
    For any row in your results table, you can click to view a detailed breakdown of the extracted data and analysis for that specific document or group of documents.

6.  **Targeted Q&A**
    You have the flexibility to ask questions about the entire set of documents, a specific document, or a group of documents that you've filtered.

7.  **Dynamic Updates**
    As you update or change your criteria, the overview result table updates automatically in real-time, so you always have the most current view of your data.

8.  **Download Your Results**
    You can easily download the overview result table. Beseek supports various formats, including plain text, CSV, Microsoft Excel, PDF, or even an image file.

9.  **Export Your Documents**
    Export your filtered results as a packaged set of documents. You can download them as a Zip file or save them directly to a location in your connected online storage.

10. **Automatic Workflow Saving**
    Your entire workflow—from data source to criteria and export settings—is automatically saved. You can return to it at any time to re-run it or pick up where you left off.

11. **Create Workflow Templates**
    Save any workflow as a template. This allows you to quickly create new, similar workflows without having to configure everything from scratch.

12. **Automate Your Workflows**
    If your source and export locations are online storage services, you can schedule your workflow to run at specific times or set it to be automatically triggered whenever new files are added to the source location.
